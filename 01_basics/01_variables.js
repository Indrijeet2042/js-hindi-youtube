const accountId = 133444
let accountEmail = "indrijeet2042@gmail.com"
var accountPassword = "12345"
accountCity = "Jaipur"

// accountId = 2 // not allowed
// var is an old method of declaring a variable in JavaScript and the modern way is 
// using let keyword.


accountEmail = "indrijeetprofessional@gmail.com"
accountPassword = "09876"
accountCity = "Bengaluru"

// veriables can also be declared directly without mentioning type but it's not a good practice. 

// So, basically only using const and let we can declare everything.  

console.log(accountId)
console.table([accountId, accountEmail, accountPassword, accountCity])
